This data includes simulated room impulse responses (RIRs) with various room configs.
The RIRs in this data are all generated in 16k sampling rate and 16-bit precision.

The simulated RIRs were divided into three sets based on the
ranges from which width and length of the room are sampled.
These are

small room set : uniformly sampled from the range 1m to 10m.
medium room set : uniformly sampled from the 10m to 30m.
large room set : uniformly sampled from the 30m to 50m.

In all the three sets, room height is sampled uniformly
from 2m to 5m; and absorption coefficient is sampled uniformly
from [0:2; 0:8]. In each set, 200 rooms are sampled
and 100 RIRs are sampled in each room based on speaker and
receiver position. The distance between the speaker and 
the receiver is not greater than 5m.

Two information files, rir_list and room_info are associated with each RIR set.
rir_list contains the information of each RIR file, it will probably be needed by the Kaldi reverberation script.
room_info contains the configs of each room where its data format is:
#Room_name #Room_length #Room_width #Room_height #Receiver_position_x #Receiver_position_y #Receiver_position_z #Absorption_coefficient

The script for simulating the room impulse responses (RIRs) can be downloaded at
https://github.com/tomkocse/sim-rir-preparation/

The script uses the image method [1] based on an implementation
by Habets et al [2] to simulate the RIRs.
It samples the room parameters and receiver position in the room 
and then randomly generate a number of RIRs according to different speaker positions.

To use the script you need to have MATLAB installed and 
download the RIR generator from
